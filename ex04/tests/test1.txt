Finnish winter is a cold, snowy, 
and dark season (Dec-Feb) with temperatures 
usually below freezing, ranging from around 0°C to -30°C 
or colder in the north, creating slippery ice 
and deep snow cover, but also offering stunning Northern Lights 
and cozy indoor activities, requiring warm layers 
and proper winter gear.
